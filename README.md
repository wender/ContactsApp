# This was my first contact with unit test <3
                                          
I'm using Karma with Jasmine for unit test and Protractor for E2E test                                    
You must point Jasmine to test/create.tests.js and Protractor to protractor/spec.js
Karma's config is on karma.config.js and Protractor's config on protractor/protractor.config.js
I've made a localStorage persistence using a service and i'm using a Mask directive that i made before
I'm also using bootstrap just to make it look a bit better
